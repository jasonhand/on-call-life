It's important that internal teams are aware of what's happening when an incident occurs. If we donâ€™t provide consistent updates, stakeholders will start coming around and asking.

It's also important to acknowledge awareness, status, and expectations to stakeholders beyond the internal groups of an organization. Customers, users, fans, and anyone relying on the availability of your service will want to know what's going on when an incident begins to impact them.

They have every right to this information, but we've got to find a better way to make them aware of an issue and what is being done about it.

## Acknowledgement

Just letting others know that someone is aware of the situation and "on it" can go a long way in easing the anxiety of others who may be impacted by an incident. Hearing from the provider themselves that an issue has been detected and is being investigated is almost always enough to satisfy customers and users when they first discover something isn't working as expected.

When customers are aware of an issue and it's not clear if the provider knows about it or is doing anything it can sour the relationship.

Simply acknowledging an incident provides context to everyone else that action is taking place.

Once we have acknowledge awareness of an incident we need to begin providing additional information as it becomes available. In early moments and minutes of an incident it may not be clear what the problem (or problems) is. 

Even if there isn't any information to share yet, that in and of itself is the message that should be communicated. It's important to be clear in what is known and not known.

## Clear

We should be clear in presenting what we know, what is being done and what kind of expectations should they have in terms of when they're going to hear back from us?
