Another key role to identify, in many cases, is the incident commander. An incident commander can be extremely helpful when you have got a large-scale outage that effects a lot of different components or requires coordination across many teams and different systems. They are great for making sure that engineers stay focused and they are working on their own remediation efforts... Ensuring people are not stepping on each other or undoing each other's work.  It is good to have a central person who can track what is going on and who is doing what.
