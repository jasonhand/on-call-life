To recover from incidents effectively, it's important to communicate and collaborate effectively. In order to share relevant details of what is known about an incident, who is addressing it, and more, it's important to have a method of tracking incident details.

Basic details such as:

- When did know about the problem?
- How did we find out about the problem?
- Who is awareness of the problem?
- What is being done?
- How Bad is It?

Centralizing information about an incident allows others to stay on top of what is happening and maybe even offer additional support. It helps teams track the time of each phase, and it's much easier to get a sense of how severe a problem is. What urgency, support, or resources are required? Teams can work much more effectively if they are looking at the same information.
