Are you familiar with the acronym **TTR**?

It is known as the **“Time to Recover”** or often referred to as the “time to remediate” or “time to restore.”

In other words, the total time that it takes for engineers to bring services back online… with regards to the value provided to end users and customers. It is the total duration of time for the incident?

The time to recover will vary from incident to incident and the circumstances around what contributed to the problem will rarely repeat. Because of this, measuring the TTR in aggregate can be a misleading metric.

The **Mean Time to Recover** does not reflect a valuable performance metric on either the uptime of your systems or how well (or poorly) teams can respond to and remediate service disruptions.

While not a perfect metric, it is one in which organizations can begin to measure how teams are performing when it comes to responding to incidents individually. We will need to examine the entire incident timeline to gain a broader understanding of what took place and where improvements can be made.

Most anyone who works with technology will agree that the complete prevention of problems is not very realistic.  

Instead, we must do better at knowing when something is wrong and being able to respond to it in an effective way.
