To create effective actionable alerts, you must understand their components and
characteristics. Actionable alerts have:

-   Simplicity

-   Scope

-   Context

Simplicity is self-explanatory: make your alerts easy for you and others to
understand, even if you’re reading them after being awakened at 2:00 a.m. Scope
and context should be included in the content of the alert.

Let’s look at some elements that an actionable alert should always include:

-   **The source:** information about where the alert is coming from. Many
    organizations have multiple monitoring systems in use at any one time and a
    large number of interconnected systems. It can save someone a tremendous
    amount of time if the alert says "This alert for payroll system thx-1138 is
    coming from Azure monitor subscription prod."

-   **The problem:** information about what expectation has been violated. For
    example, "This server has been returning an error 30% of the time when it
    should have been returning errors less than 1% of the time."

-   **Impact and scope:** information about the effect or impact the situation
    has had or potentially will have and the scope of that impact (ideally,
    stated from the customer’s point of view).

-   **Recommended action:** if possible, the alert should include what the
    person responding should do next, even if that is a pointer to a
    troubleshooting guide or some other documentation to find help in diagnosing
    and remediating this problem.

Including such helpful context will make operations practices around monitoring
more sustainable and make responding to alerts easier.
