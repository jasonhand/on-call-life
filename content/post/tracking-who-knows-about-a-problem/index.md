*Am I the First to Know?*

When the primary responder acknowledges an incident, they are announcing their awareness of the alert.

They may not have additional information yet, but like an alarm clock, they have to press the stop button and take action. This not only stops any continued alarms but indicates to others that YES, someone is aware and looking in to the problem.

Ok. Who else is aware? Do the right people know there is a problem?

And let's say others are aware... ?

[Tracking **What** Is Being Done About a Problem](/post/tracking-what-is-being-done-about-a-problem/) is the next thing we'll talk about.
