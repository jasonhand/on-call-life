Site Reliability Engineering is an engineering discipline devoted to helping
organizations sustainably achieve the appropriate level of reliability in their
systems, services, and products.

The key concepts to take away from this definition are:

-   **Reliability.** You learned in the introductory module that there are
    multiple aspects to reliability and later in this module, you’ll examine
    each in more detail. You also learned about the importance of reliability –
    why it matters.

-   **Sustainability.** In this context, “sustainable” refers to the role of
    people in creating a sustainable operations practice. Reliable systems,
    services, products are built by people. It is crucial to the concept of SRE
    to implement an operations practice that is sustainable over time, so that
    people are able to bring their best to the job.

-   **Appropriateness.** It’s important to understand that 100% reliability
    isn’t often possible, especially in today’s complex systems with
    dependencies on other systems. 100% reliability means zero down time, which
    also means no opportunity to make any changes or improvements that could
    create some down time. Instead of striving for a goal of absolute
    reliability, determine the appropriate level of reliability for a particular
    application or service.

The role of a site reliability engineer bridges the span between operations and
development but also goes beyond DevOps, and the SRE philosophy is the basis of
a new and more efficient and effective approach to building and operating
reliable systems and applications.
