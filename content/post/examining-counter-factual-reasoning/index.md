In the field of psychology, counterfactual thinking is a concept that’s
associated with the human tendency to invent possible alternatives to past
events – how things might have turned out differently.

*Counterfactual* means “contrary to facts,” and *counterfactual reasoning*
refers to telling a story about events that did not happen, in order to explain
the events that did. You can identify counterfactual statements by key phrases:

-   Could have

-   Should have

-   Would have

-   Failed to

-   Did not

-   If only

Some examples of counterfactual statements related to post-incident reviews:

“The monitoring system failed to detect the problem.”

“The engineer did not check the validity of the configuration before enacting
it.”

“This could have been picked up in the canary environment.”

The problem with this type of reasoning is that you’re talking about things that
didn’t happen instead of taking the time to understand how what did happen,
happened. You don’t learn anything from this speculation.
