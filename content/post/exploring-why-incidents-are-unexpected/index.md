In other words ... unplanned Work

Most of what we as engineers and technologists do is planned work.  

We spend a lot of time and effort understanding the work in front of us.  

We calculate story points.  We plan sprints. We have a pretty good idea on what we are supposed to be working on.

So, when an incident occurs, it is disruptive. It is... unplanned work.

Often, we view this as a terrible thing, but in reality, incidents are actually “investments” in supplying the value we are trying to deliver to end users.

We just need to change how we look at incidents.

Next we'll discuss the full lifecycle of an incident. From detection to analysis and everything in between. When we start to view incidents through a new lense and begin analyzing for opportunities to learn, you'll begin to see your systems for what they are and why having a response plan in place makes sense.
