*Normativity* relates to the human tendency to designate some actions and
outcomes as desirable or good and other actions or outcomes as undesirable or
bad. A norm is a standard of correctness agreed upon by a society.

When you use normative language in a post-incident review, you judge the
decisions and actions of those responding to the incident with the benefit of
*hindsight*. This language implies that there was an obviously correct course of
action that the operator should have followed.

Normative language can usually be identified by adverbs such as “inadequately,”
“carelessly,” “hastily,” and so forth.

Normative thinking leads you to judge decisions based on their outcomes. This
isn’t logical because the outcome is the *only piece of information that was not
available* to those who made the decisions and judgments.

The problem with normative thinking is that you neglect to understand how the
actions of the operators made sense to them at the time.
