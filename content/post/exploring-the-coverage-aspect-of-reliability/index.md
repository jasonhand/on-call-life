Coverage refers to how much of the data that you expected to process was
actually processed.

Reliability means getting the whole job done, every time. How can we monitor for that in a way that indicates what it's like as a user?

Another aspect of reliablity that is closely tied to data is our next one, durability. It is really crucial that data written to the service can be read back out again later when desired.
