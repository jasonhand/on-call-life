Humans make mistakes. However, *human error* is not a diagnosis; it’s a symptom.
When human error is deemed to be the reason for a failure, you may stop there
instead of further analyzing the incident to determine the *root cause –* which
is a deeper, systemic issue.

System design, organizational context, and personal context all affect when, how
and with what impact people make mistakes. *“*Human error*”* is a label that
causes you to quit investigating at precisely the moment when you’re about to
discover something interesting about your system.

The problem with the “human error” conclusion in investigations is that it
causes you to lose sight of the fact that what the humans did made sense to them
at the time. Mistakes, by definition, aren’t deliberate, so they didn’t intend
to make a mistake.

When we see or hear “human error”, it is a signal that we need to look deeper.
Root cause analysis is needed to identify the sequence of events that resulted
in the human error.
