To address some of the challenges around how we communicate we also want to find a way to create a unique channel or space for engineers to discuss the details of the incident - a “conversation bridge” in our persistent group chat tool -which for Tailwind Traders is Microsoft Teams.  

We want a channel that is unique to the incident only. We do not want conversations about other engineering efforts.We don’t want conversations about what people are doing for lunch. We ONLY want conversations related to the incident. Because then we can take that text (or data) and analyze later in a Post-incident review.
