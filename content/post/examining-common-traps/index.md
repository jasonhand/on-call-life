As we delve into our post-incident review, we need to be on guard against some
human tendencies that can lead us to inaccurate or incomplete conclusions and
distract us from accomplishing the core purpose of the review: learning about
our systems so as to improve their reliability.

Now you have a roadmap help you get started on the post-incident review process,
but it would also be useful to know about some of the obstacles you might
encounter on this journey.

Learning from your own mistakes is something everyone should all do, but you
don’t always have to experience something first-hand to learn from it. Learning
from the mistakes of others, without criticizing or judging them, allows you to
benefit from those lessons without personally suffering the consequences.

In this unit, you’ll find out about some common traps that others have fallen
into during the post-incident review process and how to avoid them.

## Trap 1: Attribution to “human error”



## Trap 2: Counterfactual reasoning


## Trap 3: Normative language


## Trap 4: Mechanistic reasoning
