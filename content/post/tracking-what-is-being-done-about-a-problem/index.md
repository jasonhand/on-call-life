**What (*if anything*) is being done?**

**Is everyone assuming someone else is looking into it?**

These types of questions emerge as additional people join to assist.

When alerts are sent to distribution lists or general chat rooms it's easy for them to be lost or at best delayed of action.

As first responders begin to assess the problem, conversations take place in persistent group chat tools such as Microsoft Teams or Slack.

It's in these conversations where the most up to date and accurate information will exist about what is taking place during an active incident.

Responders will share information as it becomes available including who and what is being done. By scrolling back through the conversation, others can quickly get an update not only on what is being done in the moment, but what has already taken place.

This saves engineers from duplicating effort, including pausing their effort to recover from the problem in order to update a ticket or send an email.

We'll talk more about a technique of managing tasks from withing chat known as chatops.

Severity and impact of incidents will vary but it's important teams are [Tracking Impact of a Problem](/post/tracking-impact-of-a-problem/) in order to spot trends as well as share details to stakeholders as services are restored.
