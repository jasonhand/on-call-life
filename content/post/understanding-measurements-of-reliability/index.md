Now that we have a better idea on the different things that we could be measuring, let's talk about what to do with the data.

Operational practices to create reliability feedback loops known as service level indicators and objectives help transform the reliability discussion.

-   **Service Level Indicators** are the measurements that you use to determine
    whether you have reached those goals; in other words, the *indicators* that
    your service is behaving reliably.
-   **Service Level Objectives** are simply the goals that you’ve set, based on
    the *appropriate level of reliability* that you want to reach.

You can use SLIs and SLOs to set appropriate goals based on the different aspects of reliability and to determine whether you are meeting those goals, using simple calculations and a basic recipe.

Now you’ll find out how to actually measure the success of your reliability efforts using Service Level Indicators (SLIs) and Service Level Objectives (SLOs).
