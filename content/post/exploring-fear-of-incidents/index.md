>"There is also a subtler effect, which is that the fear of on-call is often enough by itself to radically change peopleâ€™s behavior. Entire development teams reject outright the notion of going on call, because of the impact on their personal lives, family, and in-hours effectiveness." - Niall Murphy, Microsoft "Seeking SRE"(O'Reilly)

In some cases, we downplay the significance of an outage ... or worse ... intentionally mis-label or not report a disruption in service for fear of reprimand.

Historically, we have felt that incidents reflected poorly in several areas of our engineering efforts and the organization.  

It has not been until more recently through many of the conversations around devops and site reliability engineering, that we are starting to rethink incidents and now view them as opportunities to learn and improve our systems.
