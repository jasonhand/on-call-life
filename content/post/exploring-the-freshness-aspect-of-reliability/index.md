Freshness refers to how up-to-date the information is in situations where timeliness matters to the customer.

Freshness of what is available to users is a big component of reliability to many. If my travel booking tool is out of sync with the airline inventory, it's frustrating to delay the process because something wasn't "actually" available. Their information and therfore value to me is unreliable.

Examples would include sports scores or election results, in which the data is constantly and quickly changing. Freshness is not a factor for sites with static content that can remain the same over time, but if your site serves time-sensitive information, customers will expect that content to be kept current if theyâ€™re to consider the site reliable.

The next one is particularly important when running pipelines or batch processing systems.
