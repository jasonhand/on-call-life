      <description>&lt;p&gt;Throughput is a measure of the rate at which something is processed, or the number of transactions that a website, application, or service successfully handles over a specified period of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many factors that can affect throughput. Monitoring throughput can help you pinpoint potential problems that impact your usersâ€™ experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been said already but worth repeating often; The aspects of reliability must be measured and examined from the customer&amp;rsquo;s perspective. Objective data from as close as you can get to what they are truly experiencing provides the truest depecition of what its like to use your service.&lt;/p&gt;
