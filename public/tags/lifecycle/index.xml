      <description>&lt;p&gt;If we start to think of incidents as a normal part of a system, then we can also build some formality around the patterns and practices we inevitably see when people instinctually do what they do when something goes wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the beginning of a problem to analyzing what and how things happened, we can measure them independantly of each other. By doing so, we can look for improvements in each phase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, monitoring systems may be working as expected but because an alert was sent to a email distribution group, once people were aware of the alert, most assumed someone else was investigating the problem. The problem persisted for hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An incident can be divided into 5 phases. Detection, response, remediation, analysis, and readiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://jhandcdn.blob.core.windows.net/blob/LifecycleOfAnIncident.png&#34; alt=&#34;Lifecycle Of An Incident&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phase 1 - Detection:&lt;/strong&gt;
A problem has been detected through various tooling and practices&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phase 2 - Response:&lt;/strong&gt;
A coordinated effort to get the right people and tooling in place to diagnose, theorize, and triage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phase 3 - Remediation:&lt;/strong&gt;
Efforts made to change the system to either restore service or confirm theories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phase 4 - Analysis:&lt;/strong&gt;
Post-incident retrospective exercise to understand the the full the lifecycle of the incident including the human response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phase 5 - Readiness:&lt;/strong&gt;
Implementing knew knowledge and changes to improve and shorten the time and effects of future incidents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s touch on the detection phase just a little more in depth. This is often the best place to start improving your incident response practices. Solid monitoring is the foundation of building reliable systems.&lt;/p&gt;
