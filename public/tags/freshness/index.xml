      <description>&lt;p&gt;Freshness refers to how up-to-date the information is in situations where timeliness matters to the customer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freshness of what is available to users is a big component of reliability to many. If my travel booking tool is out of sync with the airline inventory, it&amp;rsquo;s frustrating to delay the process because something wasn&amp;rsquo;t &amp;ldquo;actually&amp;rdquo; available. Their information and therfore value to me is unreliable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples would include sports scores or election results, in which the data is constantly and quickly changing. Freshness is not a factor for sites with static content that can remain the same over time, but if your site serves time-sensitive information, customers will expect that content to be kept current if theyâ€™re to consider the site reliable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next one is particularly important when running pipelines or batch processing systems.&lt;/p&gt;
