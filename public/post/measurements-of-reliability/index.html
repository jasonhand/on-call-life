      <p>You can use SLIs and SLOs to set appropriate goals based on the different
aspects of reliability and to determine whether you are meeting those goals,
using simple calculations and a basic recipe. This is an operational practice
you can adopt to create a feedback loop in your organization to improve
reliability. SLIs and SLOs can transform the reliability discussion and bring
about positive culture change within your organization.</p>
<p>In this module thus far, you’ve learned about some useful tools that you can use
to monitor for reliability, and you know how to search and sort the data that
you collect. Now you’ll find out how to actually measure the success of your
reliability efforts using Service Level Indicators (SLIs) and Service Level
Objectives (SLOs).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Service Level Objectives</strong> are simply the goals that you’ve set, based on
the <em>appropriate level of reliability</em> that you want to reach.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Service Level Indicators</strong> are the measurements that you use to determine
whether you have reached those goals; in other words, the <em>indicators</em> that
your service is behaving reliably.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="service-level-indicators">Service Level Indicators</h2>
<p>Site Reliability Engineering uses SLIs and SROs to measure the aspects of
reliability that you learned about in Unit 2: availability, latency, throughput,
coverage, correctness, fidelity, freshness, and durability, and whether you are
meeting expectations in each applicable area.</p>
<h2 id="what-to-measure">What to measure</h2>
<p>The first question to ask in relation to the aspect you want to measure is
<em>what</em> to measure.</p>
<p><strong>Example #1: Measure availability</strong></p>
<p>How would you determine the availability of a web server?</p>
<p>You can do this by measuring the number of HTTP calls the server received and
the number to which it successfully responded. This ratio of successful calls to
total calls gives you an understanding of the server’s reliability. Multiplying
the ratio by 100 gives you a percentage.</p>
<p>For example, if the ratio is 0.5 and you multiply by 100, you can conclude that
the web server has been available only 50% of the time.</p>
<p><strong>Example #2: Measure latency</strong></p>
<p>To get an idea of the latency of the web service, you can measure the number of
operations that were completed in fewer than 10 milliseconds against the number
of total operations.</p>
<p>If, for example, dividing the first number by the second gives you a ratio of
0.8, and you multiply this by 100, your service has an 80% success rate by this
measurement.</p>
<h2 id="where-to-measure">Where to measure</h2>
<p>To have a clear picture of your reliability based on SLIs, you need to know not
only what was measured, but also <em>where</em> the measurement was taken.</p>
<p>For example, in measuring the availability of the web server above, you need to
specify whether the number of calls was measured at the load balancer or at the
server. Likewise, when measuring the latency of the web service, you should note
that the number of operations was measured at the client.</p>
<p>Why is this so crucial? If the purpose is to create a feedback loop in your
organization, in which you are able to have conversations about reliability
using objective data, it is important for the people having these conversations
to be using the same data.</p>
<p>To use a previous example, if you are trying to determine whether a web service
is meeting expectations and one person looks at data collected at the server
itself while another looks at data collected at the load balancer in front of
that web server, you may be looking at radically different sets of numbers. The
information collected from the web server itself only reflects the traffic that
actually reached that server. If there was an issue with the load balancer or
the network and half the packets never reached the web server, the two people
will have a very different picture of the situation, especially when it comes to
total number of requests.</p>
<p>This leads to the logical question: where is the best place to measure SLIs?
Unfortunately, there is not a universally “correct” answer. It’s a decision you
must make with an understanding that there are tradeoffs either way.</p>
<p>The key thing to keep in mind is based on our “prime directive” of reliability
measurement: <em>Reliability should be measured from the customer’s perspective.</em>
Thus, most of the time, you should measure at the point that most accurately
reflects the customer’s experience.</p>
<p>(Placeholder: SLI demo video here? Or create an exercise?)</p>
<h2 id="service-level-objectives">Service Level Objectives</h2>
<p>Now you know how to measure reliability using SLIs, but the ratios and
percentages that you’ve calculated only get you halfway toward fulfilling the
goal of site reliability engineering. You can now say the web server in our
example is 50% reliable, but is that the <em>appropriate level of reliability</em> as
discussed in our definition of SRE?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also useful to know the period of time to which that reliability level
applied. For how long was that 50% success rate maintained?</p>
<p>To answer these questions, you need to look at Service Level Objectives. SLOs
are statements of the objective you have from a reliability standpoint, based on
customer expectations. The basic recipe for creating an SLO consists of these
ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The “thing” you’re going to measure –</strong> number of requests, storage
checks, operations; <em>what</em> you’re measuring.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The desired proportion</strong> – for example, “successful 50% of the time,” “can
read 99.9% of the time,” “return in 10ms 90% of the time.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The time</strong> – what timeframe are you measuring: the last 10 minutes, during
the last quarter, in the previous 30 days, etc.?</p>
<p>Putting these components together and including the important “where”
information, a sample SLO might look like this:</p>
<p>“90% of HTTP requests as reported by the load balancer succeeded in the last
30 day window.”</p>
<p>(Placeholder: Basic SLO recipe graphic from Slide #94)</p>
<p>Similarly, a basic SLO measuring latency might look like this:</p>
<p>(Placeholder: Basic SLO recipe graphic from Slide #95)</p>
<p>Start with simple, basic SLOs such as these when you introduce the practice
into your organization. You can create more complex SLOs later if needed.</p>
